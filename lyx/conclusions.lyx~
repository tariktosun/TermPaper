\begin_layout Standard
The designed LQR controller proved effective in directing a simulated robotic
 manipulator to follow a trajectory output by the motion retargeter.
 Controller response was fast enough to capture the details of the retargeted
 trajectory, especially when the LQR cost matrices were adjusted for closer
 tracking.
 Controller disturbance rejection and noise rejection were found to be adequate
 but imperfect.
 Noise rejection might be greatly improved through the addition of a Kalman
 filter.
 Torque limiting was found to have an adverse effect on tracking, showing
 that this manipulator would require very powerful actuators to achieve
 human-like motion.

Future Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the future, it would be very interesting to implement a controller such
 as this on a real robot.
 The CKbot from the UPenn Modlab would be of particular interest for the
 purposes of retargeting.
 Previous experience in retargeting to CKbots resulted in very slow, jerky
 performance due to poor controller design (the controller used simply implement
ed servo feedback on position, progressing in discreet steps on a point-to-point
 basis).
 Using a more advanced controller such as this one would likely improve
 motion retargeting performance significantly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For more complicated robot systems, full state feedback is not feasible;
 feedback information is provided by a limited number of sensors.
 It also be advantageous to expand this controller by adding a Kalman filter-bas
ed observation module, as this would allow for both state estimation and
 sensor noise rejection.
